## About This Project
This is a simple app to help me wrap my head around Single Page Applications, ES6 syntax and structuring a project that uses Node.js in the backend.  Its a work in progress and I will continue to add to it and revise it as I learn new things and best practices.

## Notes About the Project
My main interest in building this project is learning about using Node.js in the backend and about how SPAs work.  I have ignored a lot of common things like compiling .vue files and SASS files with webpack, etc, so I can focus on the stuff that I am learning at the moment.  I want to add that stuff in once I have the core features down though.
